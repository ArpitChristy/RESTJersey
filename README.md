# RESTJersey

RESTful Web Services are basically REST Architecture based Web Services.
A REST API defines a set of functions to process requests and responses via HTTP protocol. 
Rest is just a concept to implement that we need an implementation.
To create an appliaction for REST you can use Maven Project with Jersey implementation.
